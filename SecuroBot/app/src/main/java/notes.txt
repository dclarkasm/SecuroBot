Twitter accounts:

The account used by the robot itself to post tweets:
Gmail: UNHSecuroBot@gmail.com
password: nhBlue22
phone: (860) 661-4449 (skype)

The account used by humans to tweet at the robot providing it with content (new jokes, RSS feeds, twitter updates, quizes, etc.):
Gmail: unhsbotmanager@gmail.com
password: nhBlue22

UNHSecuroBot, nhBlue22
UNHSBotManager, nhBlue22

TODO: (Orginized in order of priority (most important first
- make a twitter account for the robot to post tweets
- make a seperate twitter account for the robot to read tweets to generate the content (quiz links, RSS feed links, jokes, tips, etc) based on hashtags
    i.e. #securobotquiz will be a quiz link. The link will be added to a QUEUE data structure (first in, first out)
- add an interaction timer - the timer automatically quits out of activities if there is no user action taken after X time
- add surveys regarding cyber security
    - surveys results are compiled and tweeted
- add method for parsing only necessary data from twitter/RSS/webpage feeds (leave out links, hash-tags, etc)
- add a way for users to type their twitter handle to forward links to them for them to read more
- design and construct the physical body
- design and construct the mouth (LEDs amplified audio signal driver using opamp?)
~ add speech to text (might be impracticle for a noisy hallway)- have specific voice commands like:
    "Hey <name>" - gets the attention of the robot. The following commands can then be used:
    "tell me a joke" - recognizes key word joke, calls the joke function and tells a random joke
    "whats new/up?/how is it going?" - recognizes this and chooses a security topic at random (new twitter feed, joke, RSS, security tip, trending article)
    "tell me something about computer security" - recognizes something and computer security and gives a tip about personal computer security
    if no command is found, say "I dont know what you said, but <name> says <something>" random name(50 cent or something stupid), latest tweet
